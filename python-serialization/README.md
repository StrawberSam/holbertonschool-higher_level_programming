## Tasks

### 1.



Create a basic serialization module that adds the functionality to serialize a Python dictionary to a JSON file and deserialize the JSON file to recreate the Python Dictionary.

## Instructions:

Write a Python module named `task_00_basic_serialization.py` with the following functions:
```
def serialize\_and\_save\_to\_file(data, filename):
    # Your code here to serialize and save data to the specified file
    pass

def load\_and\_deserialize(filename):
    # Your code here to load and deserialize data from the specified file
    pass
```
The function `serialize_and_save_to_file` take 2 parameters:

*   `data`: A Python Dictionary with data
*   `filename`: The filename of the output JSON file. If the output file already exists it should be replaced.

The function `load_and_deserialize` take 1 `parameters`:

*   `filename`: The filename of the input JSON file This function returns a Python Dictionary with the deseialized JSON data from the file.

### Execution Output Example:
```
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from task\_00\_basic\_serialization import load\_and\_deserialize, serialize\_and\_save\_to\_file

# Sample data to be serialized
data\_to\_serialize = {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "New York"
}

# Serialize the data to JSON and save it to a file
serialize\_and\_save\_to\_file(data\_to\_serialize, 'data.json')

# Output: The data has been serialized and saved to 'data.json'
print("Data serialized and saved to 'data.json'.")

# Load and deserialize data from 'data.json'
deserialized\_data = load\_and\_deserialize('data.json')

# Output: The deserialized data
print("Deserialized Data:")
print(deserialized\_data)

Data serialized and saved to 'data.json'.
Deserialized Data:
{'name': 'John Doe', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}
```


### 2.



Learn how to serialize and deserialize custom Python objects using the `pickle` module.

## Instructions:

1 - Create a custom Python class named `CustomObject`. This class should have the following attributes:

*   `name` (a string)
*   `age` (an integer)
*   `is_student` (a boolean)

Additionally, the class should have a method `display` method to print out the object’s attributes with the following format:
```
Name: John
Age: 25
Is Student: True
```
2 - Implement two methods within this class:

*   `serialize(self, filename)`: This method will take a filename as its parameter. Using the `pickle` module, it will serialize the current instance of the object and save it to the provided filename.
*   `@classmethod` `deserialize(cls, filename)`: This class method will take a filename as its parameter. Using the `pickle` module, it will load and return an instance of the `CustomObject` from the provided filename.

3 - Save your code in a file named `task_01_pickle.py`.

> Make sure to handle possible exceptions for non-existent or malformed files. If this happens, the methods should return `None`

### Sample Test:
```
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from task\_01\_pickle import CustomObject

# Create an instance of CustomObject
obj = CustomObject(name="John", age=25, is\_student=True)
print("Original Object:")
obj.display()

# Serialize the object
obj.serialize("object.pkl")

# Deserialize the object into a new instance
new\_obj = CustomObject.deserialize("object.pkl")
print("\\nDeserialized Object:")
new\_obj.display()
```
Output:
```
Original Object:
Name: John
Age: 25
Is Student: True

Deserialized Object:
Name: John
Age: 25
Is Student: True
```


### 3.



The objective of this exercise is to gain experience in reading data from one format (CSV) and converting it into another format (JSON) using serialization techniques.

## Instructions:

1.  Begin by importing the required modules: `python import csv import json`

2.  Define a function named `convert_csv_to_json` that takes the CSV filename as its parameter and writes the JSON data to `data.json`.

3.  Inside this function:

    *   Use Python’s `csv` module to open the CSV file and read the data. Use the `DictReader` class to convert each row into a dictionary.
    *   Serialize the list of dictionaries using the `json` module.
    *   Write the serialized JSON data to `data.json`.
4.  The function should return `True` if the conversion was successful.

5.  Handle exceptions, such as `file not found`. Function should return `False` in this case.

6.  Save your work in `task_02_csv.py`.


### Testing Your Code:
```
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from task\_02\_csv import convert\_csv\_to\_json

csv\_file = "data.csv"
convert\_csv\_to\_json(csv\_file)
print(f"Data from {csv\_file} has been converted to data.json")

$ python3 main\_02\_csv.py
Data from data.csv has been converted to data.json
```
* * *

### CSV Dataset (`data.csv`) example:
```
name,age,city
John,28,New York
Alice,24,Los Angeles
Bob,22,Chicago
Eve,30,San Francisco
```
After the conversion, the resulting `data.json` file should contain:
```
\[
    {"name": "John", "age": "28", "city": "New York"},
    {"name": "Alice", "age": "24", "city": "Los Angeles"},
    {"name": "Bob", "age": "22", "city": "Chicago"},
    {"name": "Eve", "age": "30", "city": "San Francisco"}
\]
```


### 4.



In this exercise we’ll explore serialization and deserialization using XML as an alternative format to JSON.

## Instructions:

1.  Begin by importing the required modules. You can use the `xml.etree.ElementTree` module which is a part of Python’s standard library for XML processing:
```
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET
```
1.  Define two main functions:

*   `serialize_to_xml(dictionary, filename)`: This will take a Python dictionary and a filename as parameters. It should serialize the dictionary into XML and save it to the given filename.

*   `deserialize_from_xml(filename)`: This will take a filename as its parameter, read the XML data from that file, and return a deserialized Python dictionary.


1.  For `serialize_to_xml`:

*   Create a root element, e.g., `<data>`.
*   Iterate through the dictionary items and add them as child elements to the root.
*   Write the XML tree to the provided filename using the `ET.ElementTree` class.

1.  For `deserialize_from_xml`:

*   Parse the XML file using `ET.parse`.
*   Navigate through the XML elements to reconstruct the dictionary.
*   Return the constructed dictionary.

1.  Be cautious about data types. XML doesn’t differentiate between numbers and strings, etc., like Python does. You might need to manage type conversions.

2.  Save your work in `task_03_xml.py`.


### Testing Your Code:
```
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from task\_03\_xml import serialize\_to\_xml, deserialize\_from\_xml

def main():
    sample\_dict = {
        'name': 'John',
        'age': '28',
        'city': 'New York'
    }

    xml\_file = "data.xml"
    serialize\_to\_xml(sample\_dict, xml\_file)
    print(f"Dictionary serialized to {xml\_file}")

    deserialized\_data = deserialize\_from\_xml(xml\_file)
    print("\\nDeserialized Data:")
    print(deserialized\_data)

if \_\_name\_\_ == "\_\_main\_\_":
    main()
```
### Output:
```
Dictionary serialized to data.xml

Deserialized Data:
{'name': 'John', 'age': '28', 'city': 'New York'}
```
data.xml
```
<data>
    <name>John</name>
    <age>28</age>
    <city>New York</city>
</data>
```
